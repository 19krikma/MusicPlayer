# Music Player 
This program runs on JAVA8 and it main purpose is to give parents a control of what their little ones listen. Not everything that is on the internet is good for kids to listen to, so this program provides control over what will play -  just choose the folder with music, upload it to the program, which then generates buttons for every song.

# Latest Version Features
- On Startup it asks for music folder location
- If button is clicked and there is a diffrent song playing that it stops it and lunches the new clicked one

# TO-DO
- Playing button will change color or standout to show that is playing
- Pause and Resume playing buttons
- Save folder location in DATA BASE(it gets boring to enter folder location every time you run the program)
- Add pages to fit more sound tracks in the program

# Info
A little explenation about the Issue section for evey version. They describe problems that were found after realse, so no need to say why there are issues under every version if they could be fixed, they will be fixed but in the next version after that one.
