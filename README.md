# Music Player 
This program runs on JAVA8 and it main purpose is to give parents a control of what their little ones listen. Not everything that is on the internet is good for kids to listen to, so this program provides control over what will play -  just choose the folder with music, upload it to the program, which then generates buttons for every song.

# Latest Version Features
- On Startup it asks for music folder location
- If button is clicked and there is a diffrent song playing that it stops it and lunches the new clicked one

# TO-DO
- Playing button will change color or standout to show that is playing
- Pause and Resume playing buttons
- Save folder location in DATA BASE(it gets boring to enter folder location every time you run the program)
- Add pages to fit more sound tracks in the program
